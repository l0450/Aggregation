# Aggregation repo #

## In Java, aggregation is an association between classes in which one class (the whole or container) contains a reference to another class (the part or component). Aggregation represents a “has-a” relationship, where one class contains objects of another class as part of its internal structure. In this repository, we have 2 examples of how to use it. To improve the readability of both the examples in this repository, I created 2 Java packages. The first is a lib package storing the object classes, and the second one is a main package where we can find classes that run our programs ##
